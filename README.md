# Sudoku Solver
Solves any given sudoku board. 

To start, simply run the file ui.py

Click on the required tile and enter a number. If you want to delete a number click on the tile and press backspace. If you want to change the
value of a tile, click on the tile and enter the new number.

To solve the board click backspace.

## Changes in the UI: 
If you want to run the program and see the backtracking algorithm in action comment out lines 114-116 in ui.py file and un-comment lines 18-20 and 27-29 in the file
solveit.py
You will be able to see the computer in action displaying a digit in a space and going back and changing it and can be pretty cool to see it like that. However,
the program will take more time to run as compared to usual (around 2 and a half minutes).
